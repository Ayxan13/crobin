This is an implementation of a "string to int" hash table with [Robin Hood hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Robin_Hood_hashing). I have tested it as thoroughly as I could. It appears to have no bugs/leaks. I would appreciate any comments on correctness/performance/clarity. I have kept it ANSI C for simplicity.
